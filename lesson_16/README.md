# Using the Debugger

## Lab overview

A software bug refers to an error, flaw, or failure in a computer program that causes an incorrect or unexpected result. A debugger is a computer program that is used to test and find bugs (debug) other programs. You can use a debugger to step through the code. The Python Debugger (pdb) is an interactive source code debugger for Python programs. In this lab, you will use the pdb to step through the scripts you wrote in previous labs.

In this lab, you will:

- Explore the basic features of the Python Debugger
- Use the Python Debugger to step through Python scripts
