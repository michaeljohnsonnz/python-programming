# Python Turtle Experiment

Everyone in our class was given free reign to experiment with Python Turtle and see what we could come up with.

My goal was to create like a worldly flowery thingy with lots of pretty rainbow-ish colours.

## Lesson

At first I was receiving a circular import error. I named my python file `turtle.py` so `import turtle` in my script was throwing this error. A quick google search revealed my mistake so I changed the name of this file to `exercise_1.py` to remove the conflict.
