# Lab overview

In information technology, Python works well as the programming language of choice for manipulating strings, sequences, and numbers. Python is especially preferred in scientific computing applications such as physics, chemistry, and biology.

In some of the labs for the Python modules, you will perform simple sequence manipulations and calculations on human insulin, which is a well-known hormone in the human body that is responsible for regulating sugars.

In this lab, you will:

- Retrieve the protein sequence of human insulin from human preproinsulin

## Bonus: Cleaning preproinsulin-seq.txt programmatically

Cleaning source data files is a common task in computer programming. You could programmatically clean preproinsulin-seq.txt in several waysâ€”for example, by using Bash, Python, or another programming language of choice. Try using regex to programmatically strip the file of ORIGIN, its numbers, the two slashes (//), spaces, and line breaks or return carriages. You could also confirm programmatically that the file has 110 characters.
