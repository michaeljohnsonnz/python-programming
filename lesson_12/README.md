# Working with the String Sequence and Numeric Weight of Insulin in Python

## Lab overview

In the Python Basics module, you learned about variables, comments, math, concatenations, and exceptions. Now, you will apply what you have learned to the real-world application of human insulin.

You will store the protein sequence of human preproinsulin in a string variable and the weight of preproinsulin in int and float variables. Next, you will print these variables to the console, with comments that explain the code. You will do basic math and string concatenations.

In this lab, you will:

- Add comments that explain the intention and flow of your code
- Use print() to print elements of your Python code to the console
- Use string manipulations to get the sequence of insulin from preproinsulin
- Do basic math on the molecular weight and sequence of insulin
- Assign string, int, and float variables to numbers that represent the weight of insulin
- Explore Python exceptions
