# Using Functions to Implement a Caesar Cipher

## Lab overview

In programming, a function is a named section of a program that performs a specific task. Python has built-in functions like print() that are provided by the language. Additionally, you can use functions provided by other developers through the import statement. For example, you can use import math if you want to use the math.floor() function. In Python, you can make your own functions, which are called user-defined functions.

To drive the discussion of user-defined functions, you will write a program that implements a Caesar cipher, which is a simple method of encryption. A Caesar cipher takes the letters of a message and shifts each letter along the alphabet by a certain number of places.

In this lab, you will:

- Create user-defined functions
- Use several functions to implement a Caesar cipher encryption program
